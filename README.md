# SO-3-Complementary-filter
Realisation of SO(3) complementary filter from inertial measurements of acceleration, angular velocuty and magnetic field as functions of time

I was working for the current project during my collaboration with SYSNAV company. The main goal of the project was to calculate the temporal profiles of Euler angles(roll, pitch and yaw) of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using the raw data from magnetometers, gyrometers and accelerometers. The main idea consists on using of a complementary filter based on special orthogonal 3x3 matrices. More explanations and comments can be found in the complementary_filter.pdf file.

P.S. The raw data which have been treated in the frame of the current project are not provided in the current repository.
